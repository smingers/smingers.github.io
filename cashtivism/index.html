<h1>Cashtivism</h1>
<p>I donate money to things.</p>
<p>I'm fortunate to have a bit of discretionary income that I can give to causes that are important to me. This probably sounds like virtue signaling, and maybe that's unavoidable, consider it a humble act of persuasion.  If you think the following causes are worthy of support, here are the specific institutions and individuals I contribute to.  I would ask you consider doing the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hias.org/">HIAS</a>.  Formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, their slogan is "Welcome the stranger. Protect the refugee."  I make a recurring monthly donation for three reasons.  First, the Trump Administration policies toward refugees and immigrants is a cruel, nativist abomination, and HIAS is on the front-lines supporting refugee rights.  Second, the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was attacked in October 2018 by a reactionary anti-semite terrorist explicitly because the community supported refugee rights via a partnership with HIAS, and my financial support was a small way to commemorate the dead and stand in defiance of terrible bigotry.  Third, I have a personal connection to HIAS - the leader of the Baltimore chapter helped my maternal grandparents - who were refugees and Holocaust survivors - get settled, learn English, find jobs, and gain citizenship.  I consider my support a small effort to give thanks for that assistance from +70 years ago.</p>
