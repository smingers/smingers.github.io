	<h1>Hi, I'm Jordan Berman</h1>

	<p>I'm an American living in Paris, France.</p>

	<h2>Workies</h2>

	<p>I'm a product manager with fifteen years experience working with the earliest stage startups up to the largest enterprises.  I'm interested in using software to make people's lives more fulfilling and and their choices more meaningful.  I want to help get people off their devices and into the world.  I like building software that provides people with value they are willing to pay for.  I have never worked in an ad-supported model and I'd like to keep it that way.</p>

	<p>I like building software because doing it well takes a team of people of diverse skills and perspectives.  I like it because it’s often hard, and the hard things are rarely technical.  Software challenges are fundamentally human challenges: understanding the needs of others, making and committing to decisions, learning and adapting.  I’ve spent most of my career trying to get good at these things, and teaching others to do the same.</p>

	<p>Currently I work at <a href="https://pivotal.io">Pivotal</a>, helping customers across Europe adopt our practices and products to ship better software at enterprise scale.</p> 

	<p>I do some things:</p>

	<p><a href="/cashtivism/">I support some causes...with money!</a></p>

	<p><a href="/workshops/">I run workshops!</a></p>
