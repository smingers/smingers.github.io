	<h2 class="tldr" aria-label="Too long, didn't read">TL;DR:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>I <a href="/workshops">run workshops and give talks</a> about building great product organizations</li>
		<li>Actually, that's it for now</li>
	</ol>
	</p> -->

	<h3 class="cutout-heading">What I Believe</h3>

	<p>Building great products requires both art and science and they are made by teams with broad experiences and skill sets. 

		They are the product of trial, error, intuition, and some luck. They are grounded in profound understanding of people's needs and wants. 
		
		They are the accumulation of rigorous decisions, informed by data but made by people closest to the user. They require craft and meticulous editing. 
		
		They deliver radical improvements over the status quo because the teams that build them are willing—and able—to go back to first principles.
		</p>

	<h3 class="cutout-heading">Work</h3>

	<p>I'm a product manager with over fifteen years of experience. I have worked with the earliest stage startups up to
		the largest global organizations and have been fortunate enough to see a couple exits (both acquisition and IPO).
		Most recently, I work at <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com">VMware</a>'s Tanzu (formerly Pivotal) Labs, helping 
		customers across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa adopt our PaaS products and lean product development practices 
		to ship better software at enterprise scale.</p>

	<p>For most of the past decade I've built and managed teams of other PMs, engineers, designers, and solution architects.
		I derive the most satisfaction professionally from coaching and mentoring, helping people find the true source of their 
		talent and get the most out of it.
	</p>

	<p>I'm interested in using software to make people's lives more fulfilling and their choices more meaningful. I want
		to help get people off their devices and more fully into the world. I want to create software that people value
		enough to pay for with their money, not merely with their attention or personal data.</p>

	<p>I enjoy the craft of software because doing it well takes a team of people of different skills and perspectives. I
		relish the difficulty of building things that are powerful yet intuitive. Software challenges are fundamentally
		human challenges: understanding the needs of others, making and committing to decisions, learning and adapting,
		taking responsibility for the consequences of your actions. I’ve spent most of my career trying to get better at
		these things, and teaching others to do the same.</p>

	<h3 class="cutout-heading">Personal</h3>

	<p>I'm an American living in France since 2018. I came here speaking barely enough French to order a meal at a restaurant, 
		and <i>maintenant je suis presque bilingue.</i>
