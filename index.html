	<h2 class="tldr" aria-label="Too long, didn't read">TL;DR:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>I <a href="/workshops">run workshops and give talks</a> about building great product organizations</li>
		<li>Actually, that's it for now</li>
	</ol>
	</p> -->

	<h3 class="cutout-heading">Current Status</h3>

	<p>I am currently enjoying a long-planned sabbatical which commenced after the acquisition of my last employer. I'm using this time to pursue a mix of personal and professional interests.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On the personal front, I am reading French novels (currently working through Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo), learning the piano (building a répertoire of Beatles and Radiohead songs), sailing and working on my half-marathon time.</li>
		<li>Professionally, I am learning statistics and causal inference to improve how I forecast and build product, and, like almost everyone else, trying to stay abreast of AI developments and vibecoding (see <a href="#Projects">Projects</a>, below).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I am open to employment and consulting offers, whether remote or including relocation.</p>

	<h3 class="cutout-heading">What I Believe</h3>

	<p>Great products are built by great teams: people from different backgrounds with broad experiences, skill sets, and deep customer knowledge.</p>

	<p>They are the product of trial, error, intuition, and some luck. They are grounded in profound understanding of people's needs and wants.</p>

	<p>They are the accumulation of rigorous decisions, informed by data but made by people closest to the user. They require craft and meticulous editing.</p>

	<p>They deliver radical improvements over the status quo because the teams that build them are willing—and able—to go back to first principles.</p>

	<h3 class="cutout-heading">Work</h3>

	<p>I'm a product manager with over fifteen years of experience. I have worked with the earliest stage startups up to
		the largest global organizations and have been fortunate enough to see a couple exits (both acquisition and IPO).
		Most recently, I work at <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com">VMware</a>'s Tanzu (formerly Pivotal) Labs, helping 
		customers across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa adopt our PaaS products and lean product development practices 
		to ship better software at enterprise scale.</p>

	<p>For most of the past decade I've built and managed teams of other PMs, engineers, designers, and solution architects.
		I derive the most satisfaction professionally from coaching and mentoring, helping people find the true source of their 
		talent and get the most out of it.</p>

	<p>I'm interested in using software to make people's lives more fulfilling and their choices more meaningful. I want
		to help get people off their devices and more fully into the world. I want to create software that people value
		enough to pay for with their money, not merely with their attention or personal data.</p>

	<p>I enjoy the craft of software because doing it well takes a team of people of different skills and perspectives. I
		relish the difficulty of building things that are powerful yet intuitive. Software challenges are fundamentally
		human challenges: understanding the needs of others, making and committing to decisions, learning and adapting,
		taking responsibility for the consequences of your actions. I’ve spent most of my career trying to get better at
		these things, and teaching others to do the same.</p>

	<h3 class="cutout-heading" id="Projects">Projects</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Agent collaborators. The biggest risk I see in AI is offloading the cognitively demanding but vital tasks of reasoning and decision-making. Agents are skilled at producing plausible-sounding, professional analysis. It is always tempting to take the shortcut and ask the AI to analyze a problem and produce a report. But these activities are ultimately how we learn and even decide what it is we think. I am exploring ways to train and constrain LLMs to assist in human decision-making without short-circuiting our vital cognitive role—AI as complement to our own reasoning rather than substitute.</li>
		<li><a href="https://ecclesia.onrender.com">Forecasting app for startups</a>. The biggest risk to startup success is wasting limited resources on efforts that underperform—throwing good money after bad while missing better opportunities. This app (in private beta) teaches founders and their teams to apply principles of the world's best forecasters to their own product and business development activities, dramatically improving likelihood of success over time.</li>
		<li><a href="https://healthstats.onrender.com">Health stats explorer</a>. Personal project and dashboard to assemble my health data from multiple sources—my Oura ring, Polar chest strap, Strava account, smart scale, etc.—so I can see progress against my fitness goals and evaluate tradeoffs in exercise and diet approaches. It also produces a standardized dataset for open queries and statistical modeling.</li>
