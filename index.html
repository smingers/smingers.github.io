	<h1>JORDAN BERMAN</h1>
	
	<p="block">Product leader and practitioner with over a decade of experience in companies at every stage, from seed to Fortune 50. Passionate about fostering environments that provide teams the freedom to experiment, learn, and grow together.</p>

	<p>TL;DR: I <a href="/workshops">run workshops and give talks</a> about building great product organizations, and I <a href="/causes">support causes</a> that matter.</p>

	<h2>Workies</h2>

	<p>I'm a product manager with over fifteen years of experience.  I have worked with the earliest stage startups up to the largest enterprises and have been fortunate enough to see a couple exits (both acquition and IPO).  Currently I work at <a href="https://pivotal.io">Pivotal</a>, helping customers across Europe adopt our practices and products to ship better software at enterprise scale.

	<p>I'm interested in using software to make people's lives more fulfilling and and their choices more meaningful.  I want to help get people off their devices and more fully into the world.  I want to create software that people value enough to to pay for.</p>

	<p>I enjoy the craft of software because doing it well takes a team of people of diverse skills and perspectives.  I like it because it’s often hard, and the hard things are rarely technical.  Software challenges are fundamentally human challenges: understanding the needs of others, making and committing to decisions, learning and adapting, taking responsibility for the consequences of your actions.  I’ve spent most of my career trying to get better at these things, and teaching others to do the same.</p>

	<p>I have put together <a href="/workshops/">a series of talks and workshops</a> that I offer to other companies and organizations grappling with these challenges of growth.</p>

	<h2>Personal</h2>

	<p>I am currently learning French - slowly.  <i>«C’est très difficile pour moi.»</i>  I started performing improv in 2017 with <a href="https://www.witdc.org">Washington Improv Theatre</a>.  Doing improv has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life.  I still love to do it, but I don't get as many opportunities in Paris.  Maybe someday when my French improves.</p>

	<p>I used to be an avid cyclist but I don't yet own a bike in France, so I run with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/letsrunparis/">Let's Run Paris</a> when my schedule and shin bones cooperate.</p>

	<p>There are some causes that are very important to me, and <a href="/causes/">here is what they are and why I support them</a>.  They are all political in some way or another and I keep this list up-to-date as my personal understanding of our collective challenges change.
